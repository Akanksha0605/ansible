#Writing ansible script.

Create a teacher and sysadmin group.

Create linux users Fred, and Barney. Fred is a teacher and Barney is a
sysadmin.

Check if /var/tmp/systemstat exists on the target machine. If it does, Copy
systemstat from that location into Fredâ€™s home directory, and give it permissions
such that Fred is the only teacher who can write to it, and no other non-root user
can execute, read, or write to it.
